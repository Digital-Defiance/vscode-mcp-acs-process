# Extension Icon

This directory should contain the extension icon:

- `icon.png` - 128x128 PNG image for the extension marketplace

The icon should represent process management and security, such as:

- A server/process icon with a shield
- Gears with a lock
- Terminal window with security badge

For now, you can use any 128x128 PNG image as a placeholder.

To create a proper icon:

1. Design a 128x128 PNG image
2. Save it as `icon.png` in this directory
3. Ensure it has a transparent background
4. Use colors that work well in both light and dark themes
